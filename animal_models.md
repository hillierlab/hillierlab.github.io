Animal models that facilitate ideas/theories translating to therapies
Animal models are essential for translating ideas about brain function into effective therapies. While mice have been invaluable for identifying fundamental mechanisms, their sensory and cognitive systems differ markedly from those of humans. For example, a mouse’s limited visual acuity makes it an inadequate model for studying higher-order visual processing or for developing therapies to restore human vision.
To overcome these limitations, we employ feline and primate models whose brain organization, sensory processing, and behavioral repertoires more closely mirror those of humans. These models allow us to both translate emerging biotechnologies—such as gene delivery systems and neuromodulation approaches—toward human application and investigate neural functions that cannot be meaningfully modeled in rodents.
By studying these complex brains, we bridge the gap between basic neuroscience and clinical translation, advancing our understanding of human brain function and paving the way for therapies that can achieve true restoration rather than compensation.

## New Framework for Long-Term Neuronal Monitoring in Large Animals

Translational neuroscience, which aims to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical applications, faces a major obstacle: the difficulty of studying brain function in large-brained animals over extended periods. To address this, a novel protocol has been developed that combines high-resolution functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) with electrophysiology to enable long-term, multimodal monitoring of neuronal activity. This approach allows for comprehensive analysis of brain function in the same subject over several months, which reduces data variability and minimizes the number of animals needed for research. The method's success has been demonstrated through stable, reproducible recordings in cats, establishing a robust framework for longitudinal neuroscience studies. This breakthrough provides a scalable solution that overcomes the limitations of model scarcity and paves the way for more effective translational research.
