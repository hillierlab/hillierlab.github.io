Why is it so difficult to cure diseases of the human brain?
The child’s brain is remarkably flexible – during development it constantly fine-tunes its neural connections: useful links are strengthened while unnecessary ones are eliminated. In adulthood, however, this flexibility – known as brain plasticity – is largely lost. As a result, the brain can no longer repair or reorganize its circuits after developmental disorders or mental illnesses, which contributes to the persistence of conditions such as amblyopia, attention deficit disorder, or depression.
Our research aims to understand how this “closed” state could be reopened and proper brain function restored in a targeted way. The key may lie in the brain’s mid-level – mesoscale – organizational units. These small, interconnected groups of nerve cells form a bridge between the cellular level and larger brain networks, playing a decisive role in how neural connections are formed and stabilized.
If we can target and influence these units, we may be able to restore the adult brain’s ability to retune faulty connections – opening new possibilities for the treatment of developmental and mental disorders.

## Understanding "Lazy Eye": How the Brain Predicts What We See

To explore how the brain predicts visual events and how this ability is affected in neurodevelopmental disorders, this research focuses on amblyopia, commonly known as "lazy eye," as a model condition. The study uses an innovative virtual reality task where participants ride a stationary bike through a digital corridor while their brain activity is recorded with EEG. By introducing sudden, unexpected freezes in the visual motion, the experiment measures how the brain responds to these "prediction errors." The primary goal is to compare these neural responses between individuals with amblyopia and healthy controls to pinpoint how the disorder impacts predictive processing in the brain. Ultimately, this work aims to build a functional model of the brain networks involved in visual prediction and to track how they change with treatment, providing new insights into which functions can be restored.

## Uncovering the Brain's Design Principles: How Global Maps Shape Local Circuits

A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is understanding how the brain organizes itself to process the vast amount of information in the visual world, especially in animals with sharp sight. The visual cortex contains specialized maps for different stimulus features, such as an object's location in space and its orientation, but how these maps are arranged in three dimensions and interact has been poorly understood. This research employs high-resolution functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), a technique that allows for detailed 3D mapping of brain activity across multiple scales—from entire cortical areas down to fine-grained functional structures. The key finding is that the brain's large-scale map for visual space directly shapes the local patterns of neurons that detect orientation. This discovery provides crucial insight into the design principles of the visual system, explaining how it balances the need for a continuous global picture with the processing of fine local details.

## High-Resolution 3D Brain Mapping with Functional Ultrasound Imaging

A persistent challenge in neuroscience is that traditional imaging techniques force a difficult trade-off: they can capture either high-resolution detail over a very small area or a broad view with low resolution. This limitation has made it difficult to fully map the intricate, three-dimensional 'mesoscale' architecture of the visual cortex, where complex circuits for processing sight are organized. To overcome this hurdle, this research employs a novel 3D functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) method, a cutting-edge approach designed to generate high-resolution maps of brain activity across large volumes with excellent temporal precision, effectively resolving the classic trade-off. Applying this technique to the cat's visual cortex, the study has successfully created detailed 3D reconstructions of functional maps for retinotopy and orientation preference, and has even identified specific features like orientation singularities, also known as pinwheels. This work provides an unprecedented window into the complex organization of neural circuits, significantly advancing our ability to understand how the brain processes visual information.
