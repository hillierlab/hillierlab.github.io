The human brain is built from billions of specialized cells called neurons that form trillions of connections known as synapses. These connections are not random; they are organized into complex circuits and specialized regions that govern everything from our senses and movements to our thoughts and emotions.
This complex architecture is sculpted throughout development, beginning with a massive overproduction of connections in early life. Subsequently, a crucial process of synaptic pruning eliminates weaker or unused synapses while strengthening active ones, making the brain's networks more efficient. This refinement is guided by experience and occurs during specific "windows of plasticity," when the brain is exceptionally responsive to learning and organizing its circuits. Understanding this lifelong process of growth and adaptation is essential for grasping both the foundations of healthy cognition and the origins of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
 
## The House-Building Analogy

*1st variation*

The development of the brain, and the disorders that can disrupt it, can be compared to building a house. Imagine that during construction, the electrical wires installed inside the walls are too thin. This might happen because of cost-saving measures, misjudgment of future needs, or simply because the wrong wires were supplied.
Once the house is finished and freshly painted, everything seems fine. The lights work, the kettle boils water, and day-to-day life continues without issue. But one day, you try to run two high-powered appliances at the same time—for example, turning on the oven while the air conditioning is running on a hot summer day—and the circuit breaker trips.
At first, this seems like a solvable problem. You call the power company and, for a hefty fee, they upgrade your service and install a higher-rated circuit breaker. However, this creates a hidden risk: the thin wires inside your walls are not built to carry the increased load. Over time, they overheat, and in the worst-case scenario, they might cause a fire.
To prevent this, you’re left with a difficult choice: move the furniture, pack everything up, tear open the walls, and replace the wires with ones that can safely handle the load. Afterward, you have to replaster, repaint, and move back in. It’s disruptive, costly, and time-consuming, but sometimes necessary to prevent disaster.
When scientists first began to understand and access the brain in the 20th century, they often had only these kinds of crude, invasive methods at their disposal. Today, an era defined by rapid advances in biotechnology, we have far more sophisticated tools. Our research explores how we can correct developmental faults in the brain with as little disruption as possible. Instead of tearing down walls, we aim to restore lost functions—or enable those that never had the chance to develop—through minimal and precise interventions in the working brain.
