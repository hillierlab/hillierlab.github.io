Our work develops next-generation biotechnologies aimed at repairing, rather than compensating for, disrupted brain function. We focus on advancing molecular and gene delivery systems, neuromodulation technologies, and translational safety frameworks that enable durable and precise interventions in the adult brain.
A central challenge for brain-targeted therapies lies in achieving long-term efficacy and safety across species with complex neural architectures. To address this, we are refining viral vector systems for stable gene delivery and minimal immune activation, and developing robust assays to assess treatment compatibility—such as improved neutralizing antibody detection for AAV-based therapies.
Because rodents do not fully recapitulate the organization or cognitive capacity of the human brain, we extend our studies to large-brained species, including cats and non-human primates. These models provide the necessary bridge between fundamental discovery and clinically viable approaches, guiding the development of biotechnologies capable of truly restorative outcomes.

## New Standard for AAV Neutralizing Antibody Detection

Enhancing the safety and effectiveness of gene therapy relies on accurately identifying which patients are suitable for treatment. This is often complicated by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that can render adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors ineffective, yet current detection methods are often unreliable and can lead to poor patient stratification. Addressing this critical gap, a new "Constant Serum Concentration (CSC)" AAV assay has been developed to provide more precise and reproducible measurements of NAb levels. This improved method significantly reduces misclassification rates by stabilizing the assay baseline, ensuring that patients are more accurately screened for therapy. This work represents a critical step forward, promising to improve treatment consistency and expand the applicability of AAV-based gene therapies.

## Optimized Gene Therapy Delivery Method for Long-Term Brain Imaging

Genetically targeting specific brain cells is a powerful tool for understanding neural circuits and modeling diseases, but applying these techniques safely and effectively over the long term, especially in animals other than mice, remains a major hurdle. The use of gene therapy vectors, which are essential for this work, is often complicated by the body's immune response and inconsistent gene activity, limiting the reliability and duration of experiments. This research directly tackles this challenge by systematically searching for an optimal delivery method. Through extensive long-term studies involving optical imaging and immune monitoring, an optimized gene therapy approach was identified that ensures stable, long-lasting gene expression for brain imaging while significantly reducing the immune reaction. This breakthrough provides a much-needed method for safe and stable genetic access to the brain, paving the way for more advanced and reliable long-term studies of brain function.
