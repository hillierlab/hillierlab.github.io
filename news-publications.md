## New Assay Fixes Critical Flaw in Gene Therapy Screening
*29 Sept, 2205*
In a study published in Nature Gene Therapy, our lab has developed a new method that significantly improves the safety and accuracy of screening for AAV gene therapies. This new ‘Constant Serum Concentration’ (CSC) assay addresses a critical flaw in current screening processes, which can fail to detect low but clinically significant levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that block a therapy's effectiveness. Our study demonstrated that the CSC assay correctly identifies up to 21.7% more patients with these therapy-blocking antibodies than conventional methods, preventing individuals from being incorrectly deemed eligible for treatment. By providing a more reliable framework for patient selection and understanding long-term immunity, our publicly available protocol promises to lower therapy failure rates, enhance the robustness of clinical trial data, and accelerate the development of safer and more effective gene therapies worldwide.

## A diagnostic method for the development of gene therapies
*21 Aug, 2025*
In a publication in the leading journal Frontiers in Immunology, our lab has introduced coreTIA, a pioneering open-source diagnostic method designed to accelerate the development of gene therapies. A major challenge in this field is that pre-existing antibodies can neutralize these expensive treatments, but testing for them has been hampered by a lack of standardized, reliable tools. Our coreTIA method solves this by providing the first universally accessible and validated protocol to accurately measure these antibodies in blood samples across multiple species, including humans. By making this tool freely available, we aim to establish a global diagnostic standard, helping to overcome the scientific 'reproducibility crisis' and shorten the path for getting safe and effective therapies from the lab to patients who need them.
